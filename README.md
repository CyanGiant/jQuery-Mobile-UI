This lesson provided a number of interesting challenges for me, The first Issue it offered me was that the jquery ui would not load into <em>Chrome Canary</em> but functions fine within regular Chrome & Firefox:

I tried to host the offending jquery.mobile.min locally as well as using the hosted link. Further I used multiple versions of it with no difference in the results.
Once I realized that there was a compatibility issue that existed within chrome canary, and not feeling like I could figure out where to start I opted to let sleeping dogs lie and stand on firmer ground (after all, canary explicitly calls itself bleeding edge and can be buggy from time to time.)
I made good headway after this until I got to local storage.  Once I had local storage semi-implemented I needed to delete it, and once that occured I was given this error (regular old vanilla chrome now):

At this point I really had no clue as how to procede because line 1 in my html is standard boilerplate fare. I tried it on firefox and it worked fine. There is something here that doesn't quite make sense to me, however I opted to try and make progress where I could instead of pulling my hair out on an issue that I could see would take all of my time.  From this point out everything worked swimmingly for me (except that I had to use firefox, but thats a complaint for another time.)  The App is fully functional (albeit only on firefox & safari)
